<h2>Styling React Apps with Vanilla CSS - Pros & Cons</h2>


This approach has its own pros and cons:
## Pros:

We separate the CSS file from the JSX code, which allows different team members to work without interrupting each other.

## Cons:

CSS codes are not scoped to a component, which can lead to CSS rules clashing across components.

To solve the issue of CSS clashes, we can use inline styling, but that is also not the best solution.
