Question 3:

What's the problem with this code?
<div>
  {someArray.map(item => <p>{item}</p>)}
</div>

 the problem with this code. When dynamically outputting a list of elements, every element should receive a unique "key" to help React tell the list items apart.

.map(num => <li key={num}>{num}</li>)
