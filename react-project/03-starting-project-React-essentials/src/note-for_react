by default , react component execute only once.
you have to tell react if a component should be executed again.

state: in react is registering variables that are handled by react and that are updated with the help of a function that's provided by react.

that tell react the data changed and cause react to update the UI.

In react all function start with "use" called react hooks. are regular functions
Rules of Hooks:
1 this hook function must called directly inside of component function, or custem hooks.
2 only call hooks on the top level not nested with other function.
