Which of the following four code examples for setting & extracting props would NOT work as intended?

I.e., which example will NOT output the text "Priority: 5" on the screen.

That's the right choice.
The error is subtle but this example does 
NOT use object destructuring. So here, the "priority" prop is not pulled out of the props object. Instead,
it's now the entire props object that's named "priority". This wouldn't be a problem since the name is up to you. But it's now the entire 
object that's output in the paragraph, not the "priority" property. Therefore, the output would not be "Priority: 5" but instead "Priority: [Object object]" (or something like that).
