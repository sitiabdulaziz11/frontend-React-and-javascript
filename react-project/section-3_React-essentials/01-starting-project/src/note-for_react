by default , react component execute only once.
you have to tell react if a component should be executed again.

state: in react is registering variables that are handled by react and that are updated with the help of a function that's provided by react.

that tell react the data changed and cause react to update the UI.

In react all function start with "use" called react hooks.
Rules of Hooks:
1 this hook function must called directly inside of component function.
2 only call hooks on the to level not nested with other function.
