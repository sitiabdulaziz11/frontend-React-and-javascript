let userMessage = 'Aselamu aleycum World!'
console.log(userMessage);
console.log(userMessage); // using variable is usefull if we want to change the value we only change in on palce instade of multiple place.
// we also create variable with const like
const userDisplay = 'Aselamu aleycum World!'
// the key diference is with const must not be reassigned. e.g
userDisplay = 'new' // i get error b/c it is read only b/c it is const.

// we can create values when we need them.
// to stor values we use variables.
// variables are data containers 
// where we stor value in variable which carries any name of our choose.
// then we use that variable as an identifier in our code to refer to that value that's stored on this variable whenever we need that value.
