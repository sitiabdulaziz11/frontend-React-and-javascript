what is SET?
ChatGPT
In SQL, SET is a keyword used in the context of the UPDATE statement to specify the columns that are to be modified and the values they should be updated to.

When you use SET in an UPDATE statement, you provide a list of column assignments separated by commas. Each assignment consists of the column name followed by the new value to which it should be set. Here's the general syntax:

sql

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
table_name: Specifies the name of the table you want to update.
column1, column2, ...: These are the names of the columns you want to update.
value1, value2, ...: These are the new values that you want to assign to the respective columns.
WHERE condition: This is an optional clause that allows you to specify which rows should be updated. If omitted, all rows in the table will be updated.
For example, consider a table named employees with columns salary and department. If you wanted to increase the salary of all employees in the "Engineering" department by 10%, you would use an UPDATE statement with SET like this:
